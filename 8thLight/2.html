Many years later, I found myself working in a position that required a lot of manual data entry/manipulation. I knew that there had to be a better way to get that work done, so I took it upon myself to learn how to automate routine tasks in Excel with functions &amp; VBA. Once I got started, I was hooked! I loved being able to augment my abilities and get work done hundreds/thousands of times faster. It seemed like a form of time travel, where I could conjure up some script and jump ahead to a point in the future where I had done hours &amp; hours of tedious work, without actually having to do it myself.</p> <p>Once I got past that initial barrier, I found myself wanting to learn more and did so by working on an endless queue of personal projects. I started off with Python; writing automation scripts &amp; extending SublimeText to improve my development workflow, and also prototyping a few app ideas with Kivy. Then I got into mobile app development for a while, mostly working with Java &amp; Kotlin in Android Studio. While looking for a more efficient way to develop cross-platform apps, I tried out a few options like Xamarin &amp; Flutter before finally settling on web development as my primary focus after finding out about PWAs and the very expansive, developer-friendly ecosystem that web development offers. I've also experimented a bit with Unity &amp; TouchDesigner, and am very interested in interactive audio-visual experience design.</p> <p>Most of my programming experience has been gained from working on personal projects, and most recently from working as a (<em>solo</em>) contracted developer at a local eCommerce company. I'd love an opportunity to work with other developers to build bigger projects than I could manage on my own, and would very much enjoy the learning opportunities &amp; growth that come along with that. I especially resonate with &amp; appreciate 8th Light's principles; working for a company that values &amp; promotes growth, learning, &amp; excellence is pretty much my ideal career scenario!</p></section></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
